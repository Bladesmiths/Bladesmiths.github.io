Back again for Week 5’s update! Apologies that, again, this update is a bit late. We’ve been so preoccupied this week with just trying to catch everything up and keep our heads above water that some things got lost. As a result, we also don’t have as much tangible progress this week as we have in the past, but that’s looking like it will be changing next week.

In any case, we started the week finishing up everything necessary for us to run a successful playtest in class on Tuesday. Tuesday we spent most of the day either playtesting or starting work on analyzing the notes and results from the playtest. At this point, the playtest was mostly just for testing essential combat actions like movement and attacking, but we still received some really useful feedback, especially regarding how to improve our future tests. So, a lot of our progress this week has been cleaning things up that had to be pushed to the wayside a bit because of said playtest or cleaning things up that caused problems during the playtest.

On the art side, our artists are continuing to provide us with some really amazing work. We’ve made some changes regarding the priority of different assets because of our scope change last week, but all seems to still be going well. Regardless, you can see all of the art updates below.

Specific Progress:

And we’re back! Sorry this is coming out quite a bit late everyone, but it’s been a crazy few weeks. We’re back on track now though. So this was the first week of the spring semester and it was also the start of our first sprint since we’d come back. We extended Sprint 9 to last the entirety of break since we knew we’d all be busy and we didn’t want to have to have meetings in the middle of break to figure out more organizational things. So that’s why we’re only 2 sprints ahead of where we left off in December. 

In terms of what we’ve actually accomplished, we all took a much needed break for most of break so we didn’t accomplish quite as much as we may have liked to. We did try to get some things done though, mostly things that we’d been wanting to do, but we knew were going to take a while so we couldn’t really do them during a normal sprint without breaking them up a lot. We also did a bunch of bug fixing and made some other smaller changes towards the end of break. 

As for art, our artists also took a well-deserved break. So our art progress is a bit lighter this week, but they’re all ready to go for next week, and they’ve already started on new artwork for the coming week. 

That’s all for now, so moving onto specific details:

## Art

<h2 class="section-heading">High Concept Statement</h2>

<p class="section-body">Our capstone project is a 3rd-person Action game centered around a fluid, multi-weapon combat
    system. The events of the game will focus on fighting various enemies to collect three swords. The game will
    culminate in a boss fight where the player will use the skills and abilities they have gathered to defeat their
    enemies and save their home.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Features</h2>

<ul class="section-body">
    <li>A horde of bandits will descend on your town to steal the sacred sword and its associated powers. After a
        horrific war, you are one of the only remaining able-bodied “adults.” As a result, you’ve been tasked with
        mastering this blade and fighting them off.</li>
    <li>In a short tutorial, the player will start with a training sword, learning the controls and mechanics of the
        game.</li>
    <li>As you progress, you will unlock three unique swords. Each sword gives you access to new abilities and greater
        adaptability in combat.</li>
    <li>Each sword is designed to focus on different aspects of combat: power, speed, and health. However, switching to
        a different sword will take time, forcing players to consider the optimal sword(s) for each situation. </li>
    <li>The player will also have the ability to block, dodge, and parry enemy attacks.</li>
    <li>Throughout the game, there will be three enemy types. One standard enemy and two enemies that are designed
        around the power and speed swords.</li>
    <li>After obtaining all three swords, the player will end up back at their town to face off against the bandit
        leader.</li>
</ul>

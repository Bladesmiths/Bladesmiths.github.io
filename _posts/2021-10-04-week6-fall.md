## Intro

Wow, we’re already done with Week 6! We’re back on track making progress this week and we’re also about to end our third Sprint. Most of our progress this week had to do with updating things and fixing things that we found were problems in our first playtest. Specifically, we worked a lot on giving the player better feedback regarding our combat actions. We’ve finally been able to add in some more temporary animations this week and we should have all of the Player’s combat actions visually represented with animations for our next test. We also worked on making our scene more contextual. We want the goals of this next playtest to be clearer and we also want those goals to relate more to what the player will actually be doing in-game.

In terms of art, there was a lot of progress iterating on previous concepts this week. We have updated versions of the player, their clothing, and their swords down below. We also have an updated version of our logo due to some comments from one of the faculty members helping us with our project. The initial in-game UI design that Effie worked on also has us all really excited.

Beyond that, most of our progress has been on things that aren’t quite finished yet, but hopefully will be soon. So on to specific progress:

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Xy created a new colored version of the Player’s Bracer.</li>
    <li>Xy also iterated on the Player’s cape, making it fit the Player’s frame better.</li>
    <li>Sofia updated the Player’s Concept Sheet.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>New belt design.</li>
        <li>Changed some colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Sofia also updated the Player’s sword concepts.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>Some initial coloring and design changes from feedback from last week.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Effie iterated again on the logo for the project, changing the design of the shatter due to some faculty feedback.</li>
</ul>

## Design

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Kyle started working this week on a spreadsheet to help us with balancing our game.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>This should help us visualize and summarize the statistics of the objects in our game much easier.</li>
        <li>Mathematical balancing isn’t perfect, but it’s a good starting point.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We all also started designing the scene for our next playtest with more contextual challenges.</li>
</ul>

## Development

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>John did a lot of work this week restructuring our base movement code and the Player’s state machine.</li>
    <li>John also worked on the implementation of the Player’s Dodge action quite a bit.</li>
    <li>Rudy has done a lot of work this week looking into improving our workflow by creating a better Level Editor.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>It would allow us to load more than 1 Unity scene at a time without manually doing it all.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Trent worked on implementing the Player’s Attack animation.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>It’s a temporary animation for now, but the framework is there for when we get a more final model and animation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Nick worked on improving our Prototype Scene.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>Our goal is for the next prototype to be much more contextual so the scene should be closer to what the game will look and feel like.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Nick also created a simple main menu scene to go along with the improved Prototype Scene.</li>
    <li>Trent also worked on fixing some bugs we were still having with movement and camera positioning.</li>
</ul>

## Management

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Everyone on the team worked on creating and defining more cards in our task board.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>We’ve all been working to get better at doing this as we’re developing so that we don’t start new sprints with no tasks defined.</li>
        <li>Ideally, we have a list of things to pull from already and we just have to decide which are top priority.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Rudy made some changes to our Discord server, making it easier for us to communicate with our artists and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

## Documentation

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Trent updated the Production & Playtest sections of our Design Doc according to new scope details and faculty feedback.</li>
    <li>Kyle updated the Game Design section of the Design Doc to reflect changes to our scope.</li>
</ul>

That should be about all for this week. Thanks again to everyone following.

Back again for another update, folks! It’s crazy that it’s already Week 9. It feels like just yesterday that we were doing our initial brainstorming for the project. This week included the end of a sprint and the start of a new one so, as usual, we conducted our Sprint Review, Retrospective, and Planning meetings. We’ve changed more of our process this sprint than usual because we’ve had some issues with time management in meetings and meeting topics in general, among other things, but nothing too big. And so far, the changes seem to be working really well.

Regardless, we don’t have as much development progress this week, as it’s been busy for everyone, but we’re still working. A lot of the development team’s progress this week was actually design-related. We’ve been working on revising and refinishing our ideas for the enemies in the game, and we’re really excited about what we’ve come up with. Hopefully by next week we have some concepts to show. We’ve also been working a lot on our pitch presentation. On Thursday, the 28th, all of the teams in the class are delivering a pitch to the faculty of the department and we’re trying to make sure we’re including everything that we want to include.

On the art side, we’re still working on iterating on sword concepts, but we’re getting very close now and we’re starting on modelling them as well. The player character’s model is also getting really close. At this point, most of Xy’s changes have been in response to nitpicks by the development team or things we weren’t sure on.

I think that’s about it though, so here’s our specific progress for the week:

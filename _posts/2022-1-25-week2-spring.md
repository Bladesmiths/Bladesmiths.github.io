So this week was our first full week back in classes and back up to speed. We made quite a bit of progress this week finishing up the things we’d been working on over break and getting things ready for the first playtest of the spring semester. We also changed a bunch of things with our meeting structure because of new schedules, and we set up new meetings with all of our committee members. So, needless to say, it’s been a busy week. 

Our artists continue to amaze, as this week we’ve got more new work from them, all the way from concept art to rigging. 


And with that, I’ll continue with detailed notes: 

## Art

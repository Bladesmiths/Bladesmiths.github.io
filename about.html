                    <em>The Shattering Swords (TSS)</em>
                    is a 3rd-person action game centered around a real-time weapon-switching combat system.
                </p>
                <p class="my-2"><i class="fas fa-swords mr-2"></i>Combat is Dark Souls-style but you have a magical
                    sword that can change its shape on the
                    fly when exposed to various gemstones.</p>
                <p class="my-2"><i class="fas fa-swords mr-2"></i>You play as a reluctant hero who takes up the sword to
                    defend their village from a horde
                    of bandits.</p>
                <p class="my-2"><i class="fas fa-swords mr-2"></i>You'll slash, roll, and parry your way through combat
                    encounters, gathering new
                    gemstones and mastering your weapon.</p>
                <p class="my-2"><i class="fas fa-swords mr-2"></i>The game culminates in a boss fight against the
                    fearsome bandit leader, who wields a
                    sword that mirrors your own.</p>

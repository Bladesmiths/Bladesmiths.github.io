Alright so back for another weekly update, and, once again, sorry this is a bit late. This post may be a bit shorter because I was gone for the week and wasn’t there to keep track of everything so I can only pass on what I was told. 

Progress this week was mostly starting to look over the feedback we received from the playtest the week before and starting address those concerns. It seems that most people really liked the new level so we have a bit of tweaking left to do there, but we’re probably going to leave it mostly in the state it’s in since we’re starting to get down to the wire on development time. Our biggest concern after the playtest was enemy and boss behavior and how all the enemies interact with the player. So this week and next, we’ll be doing a lot of tweaking with our enemies and boss. 

The other big thing we devoted time to this week is our submission to RIT’s Department of Interactive Games and Media (our department) Showcase. Basically, it’s just a way for students of any year to show off the games and projects they’ve been working on and potentially win some awards for it. So we had to put together some materials for that like a video and some explanation of our project. Hopefully, we’ll hear more about that soon, but, in the meantime, so you all can see what we’ve been working on a little better, our video trailer will also be up in our about page!

As for art, John’s started on some more audio tracks, Kesavan’s done a bunch more work on our visual effects, and Sofia created some really cool painted versions of our boss and amethyst sword concepts. Xy also started on texturing the enemy, and Effy made a bunch of animations for them. So hopefully we’ll have some really cool enemy progress to show in a couple of weeks. 

With that, we’ll move on to specific progress:

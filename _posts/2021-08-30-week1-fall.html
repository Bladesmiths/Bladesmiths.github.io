<p class="section-body">Hey everyone! So this week was our first week of classes, meaning that a lot of our processes
    for the summer had to change. This slowed down development on the actual prototype a bit, but not because we were
    busy working on other things. Really, it was more a case of pivoting our priorities since we have specific
    assignments that need to be completed now.
</p>

<p class="section-body">So, in any case, this first week’s progress was a lot more Design Doc and Project Management
    related than previous weeks, trying to update our processes to work more efficiently in this new situation and
    trying to organize our ideas into a more cohesive single document than the many documents we had before.
</p>

<p class="section-body">Onto specific progress:</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Art</h2>

<ul class="section-body mt-4">

        <li>Some will need some refining, but you’ll see that progress next week. </li>
    </ul>

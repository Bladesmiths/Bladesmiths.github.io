Alright, so obviously this one is backdated just a bit. Thanksgiving was a bit hectic for all of us, but we’re back now, refreshed a bit and ready to get back to work. Moving back to week 13, a big chunk of our time was spent on documentation updates. It’d been a while since we’d really gone through everything and updated it, and we also were asked to have a completely updated version to show to the MS cohort behind us. You can read more about the specific documentation updates below. 

While we were updating the doc, we also started a new sprint, so we also had some work to do there with figuring out our priorities for the next sprint. We ended up deciding to switch the final sprint to 3 weeks rather than 2 because Thanksgiving break was right in the middle of it. As a result, sprint 7 will actually run right up to the last day of classes. Our main priority for the sprint is a playtest build on December 2nd, and I can’t wait to show that off. There should be some really cool stuff coming down the pipe. 

After finishing up with documentation and sprint maintenance though, we did finally get a chance to do a bit of dev work. John and Kyle both started on some of the exciting things I just mentioned, and I fixed our target lock functionality again. Hopefully this time we’re actually able to show it off. 

Other than that, there were a few art updates you can see and read about below, but really it was just another week, progressing towards the inevitable end of the semester and our final presentation for the semester. So moving forward with specific progress:

## Development

    </ul>
    <li>I fixed target lock...again</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>Most of the fixes this time were related to moving the target reticle to screen space rather than world space</li>

That just about covers it this week. No update for Thanksgiving week because of the break, but a slightly longer one should be incoming for the final week of the semester. Thanks again!

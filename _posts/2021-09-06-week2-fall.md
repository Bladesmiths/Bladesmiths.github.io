## Intro

And we’re back again! Despite a lot of personal things going on and a power outage for a couple
    of our team members this week, a lot of progress has been made since last week across pretty much every area of the
    project. The prototype is really coming along, our artists are making some great progress, and more is being filled
    out in our Design Document everyday.

In other news, this week was the end of Sprint 1 (explained below) so we’ll be re-assessing
    progress and goals at the beginning of Week 3, and it looks like one of our main goals for Sprint 2 will be getting
    the prototype in a stable state for playtesting in the last 10 days of September following the end of that sprint.
    Wish us luck!

Specific Progress:

## Art

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Sofia revised the bracer concepts from last week, simplifying them a lot to fit our aesthetic.</li>
    <li>Xy started working on our character model.</li>
    <li>We worked a lot on refining our game’s aesthetic with the help of our artists and professors.</li>
</ul>

## Design

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Our Design discussions this week were limited mostly to early Level Design.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>Trying to explain in general how we wanted things laid out and what features we wanted in each area.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Development

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>The framework for Parrying is in place. Enemies need to be able to attack though before it can really be
        finished.</li>
    <li>The Player can theoretically be damaged and die now! (Enemies to come).</li>
    <li>The framework for the Player’s roll action is nearly in place. This will allow the Player to dodge enemies’
        attacks.</li>
    <li>Our Target Locking system is finally working, at least provisionally. As with anything right now there are still
        some kinks to iron out, but we’re making progress.
        <div class="row mt-3">

                alt="Target Lock Progress">
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>


## Management

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>We started contacting and meeting with our new committee members, setting up regular meetings with the ones that
        wanted them.</li>
    <li>We started working on defining new tasks for next week since we’ll be starting a new sprint next week.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>A sprint is (for us) a 2 week block of work with a set goal.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Documentation

<ul class="section-body mt-4">
    <li>Tons more progress on our Design Doc.</li>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>Introduction is done for now.</li>
        <li>Executive Summary is done for now.</li>
        <li>More progress on the Game Design section (it’s a long one).</li>
        <li>Edits were made to the Production section based on some feedback we received from our professors and to add
            our 2 new artists.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We also made a presentation to explain our refined aesthetic ideas (necessary for class but also helpful in
        communicating our ideas to committee members and artists).</li>
</ul>

<p class="section-body">That about sums up Week 2. Hope everyone had a fantastic Labor Day weekend!</p>
